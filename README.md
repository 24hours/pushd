Getting Started
===============

### Register

At first launch, your app must register with the push notification service to get a registration id. It then provide this registration id to pushd in exchange of a device id (This device id will be used with all further communication with pushd). Some information can be sent with the request to pushd like device language, version or current badge value.

Device registration is performed thru a HTTP REST API (see later for more detail). Here is an example of device registration simulated using the curl command. As an example, we will register the iOS device registration id `FE66489F304DC75B8D6E8200DFF8A456E8DAEACEC428B427E9518741C92C6660`. For iOS, we have to specify the `apns` protocol. We also set the device language to `fr` for French and init the badge to `0`. We suppose the command is run on the same machin as pushd:

    $ curl -d proto=apns \
           -d regid=FE66489F304DC75B8D6E8200DFF8A456E8DAEACEC428B427E9518741C92C6660 \
           -d lang=fr \
           -d badge=0 \
           http://localhost/devices

As answer, we will get a JSON object like this:

    {
        "proto":"apns",
        "regid":"fe66489f304dc75b8d6e8200dff8a456e8daeacec428b427e9518741c92c6660",
        "lang":"fr",
        "badge":0,
        "updated":1332953375,
        "created":1332953375,
        "id":"J8lHY4X1XkU"
    }

Your app must save the `id` field value, it will be used for all further communication with pushd.

### Subscriptions

Depending your service, your app may auto-subscribe the device to some events or ask the user which events he want to be subscribed to (An event is identified as an arbitrary string meaningful for you service). For each event your app want to be subscribed to, a call the the pushd API have to be performed.

For instance, if your app is about news, you may want to create one subscriptable event for each news category. So if our user want to subcribe to `sport` events, the following call to pushd will have to be performed:

    $ curl -X POST http://localhost/device/J8lHY4X1XkU/subscriptions/sport

You may later unsubscribe by replacing the `POST` by a `DELETE` method.

We recommand to auto-subscribe your users to some global event like for instance a country event if your app is international. This will let you send targetted message to all users of a given country.

### Event Ingestion

Once we have registered devices, our service may start to send event. Events are composed of a message, optionally translated in serveral language and some additionnal data to be passed to your application. To send an event, you may either use the HTTP REST API or send UDP datagram.

You don't need to create event before to send them. If nobody is subscribe to a given event, it will be just ignored. It's thus recommanded to send all kinds of events that may be of interest and let your application choose which want to subscribe.

Here we will send message to all devices subscribed to the `sport` event:

    $ curl -d msg=Test%20message http://localhost/event/sport

Device Registration
-------------------

### Register a Device ID

Register a device by POSTing on `/devices` with some device information like registration id, protocol, language, OS version (useful for Windows Phone OS) or initial badge number (only relevant for iOS, see bellow).

    > POST /devices HTTP/1.1
    > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    > 
    > proto=apns
    > regid=FE66489F304DC75B8D6E8200DFF8A456E8DAEACEC428B427E9518741C92C6660&
    > lang=fr&
    > badge=0
    > 
    ---
	< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
	< Location: /device/JYJ1ehuEHbU
	< Content-Type: application/json
    < 
    < {
    <   "created":1332638892,
    <   "updated":1332638892,
    <   "proto":"apns",
    <   "regid":"FE66489F304DC75B8D6E8200DFF8A456E8DAEACEC428B427E9518741C92C6660",
    <   "lang":"fr",
    <   "badge":10
    < }
*Carriage returns are added for readability*

#### Mandatory parameters:

- `proto`: The protocol to be used for the device. Use one of the following values:
	- `apns`: iOS (Apple Push Notification service)
	- `c2dm`: Android (Cloud to Device Messaging)
	- `mpns` Window Phone (Microsoft Push Notification Service)
- `regid`: The device registration id delivered by the platform's push notification service 

#### Allowed parameters:

- `lang`: The language code for the of the device. This parameter is used to determine which message translation to use when pushing text notifications. You may use the 2 chars code or full culture language code (i.e.: en_CA) or any value you want as long as you provide the same values in your events. See below for info about event formating.
- `badge`: The current app badge value. This parameter is only relevant for iOS for which badge counter must be maintained server side. On iOS, when user read or load more unread items, you must inform the server of the badge's new value. This badge value will be incremented automatically by pushd each time a new notification is sent to the device.
- `version`: This is the OS device version. This parameter is only needed by Windows Phone OS. By setting this value to 7.5 or greater an `mpns` device ids will enable new MPNS push features.

#### Return Codes

- `200` Device previousely registered
- `201` Device registered successfuly
- `400` Specified registration id or protocol is invalid

### Update Device Registration Info

On each app launch, it is highly recommanded to update your device information in order to inform pushd your device is still alive and registered for notifications. Do not forget to check if the app notifications hasn't been disabled since the last launch, and call `DELETE` if so. If this request return a 404 error, it means your device registration have been cancelled by pushd. You then have to forget the device id and register the device again in pushd. Your pushd device registration can be cancelled if pushd ecouentered a too high number of push errors or if the target platform push service informed pushd about an inactive device (i.e. Apple Feedback Service).

    > POST /device/DEVICE_ID HTTP/1.1
    > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    >
    > lang=fr&badge=0
    >
    ---
    < HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

#### Allowed parameters:

- `lang`: The language code for the of the device. This parameter is used to determine which message translation to use when pushing text notifications. You may use the 2 chars code or full culture language code (i.e.: en_CA) or any value you want as long as you provide the same values in your events. See below for info about event formating.
- `badge`: The current app badge value. This parameter is only relevant for iOS for which badge counter must be maintained server side. On iOS, when user read or load more unread items, you must inform the server of the badge's new value. This badge value will be incremented automatically by pushd each time a new notification is sent to the device.
- `version`: This is the OS device version. This parameter is only needed by Windows Phone OS. By setting this value to 7.5 or greater an `mpns` device ids will enable new MPNS push features.

NOTE: this method should be called each time the app is openned to inform pushd the device is still alive. If you don't, the device may be automatically unregistered in case of repeated push errors.

#### Return Codes

- `204` Device info edited successfuly
- `400` Format of the device id or a field value is invalid
- `404` The specified device does not exist

### Unregister a Device ID

When the user choose to disable notification from within your app, you can delete the device from pushd so pushd won't send further push notifications.

    > DELETE /device/DEVICE_ID HTTP/1.1
    >
    ---
    < HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

#### Return Codes

- `204` Device unregistered successfuly
- `400` Invalid device id format
- `404` The specified device does not exist

### Get information about a Device ID

You may want to read information stored about a device id.

    > GET /device/DEVICE_ID HTTP/1.1
    >
    ---
    < HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    < {
    <   "created":1332638892,
    <   "updated":1332638892,
    <   "proto":"apns",
    <   "regid":"FE66489F304DC75B8D6E8200DFF8A456E8DAEACEC428B427E9518741C92C6660",
    <   "lang":"fr",
    <   "badge":10
    < }
*Carriage returns are added for readability*

#### Return Codes
- `200` Device exist, information returned
- `400` Invalid device id format
- `404` The specified device does not exist

### Subscribe to an Event

For pushd, an event is represented as a simple string. By default a device won't receive push notifications other than broadcasts or direct messages if not subscribed to events. Events are text and/or data sent by your service on pushd. Pushd's role is to convert this event into a push notification for any device subscribed to it.

You subscribe a previousely registered device by POSTing on `/device/DEVICE_ID/subscriptions/EVENT_NAME` where `EVENT_NAME` is a uniq string representing the event. You may post an option parameter to configure the subscription.

	> POST /device/DEVICE_ID/subscriptions/EVENT_NAME HTTP/1.1
	> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    >
	> ignore_message=1
    >
    ---
	< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

#### Allowed Parameter

- `ignore_message`: By default to 0, if turned to 1 the message part of the subscribed event won't be sent with the notification. On iOS, the badge will still be incremented and updated. You can use this to update the badge counter on iOS without disturbing the user if he didn't want to be explicitely notified for this event but still want to know how many new items are available. On Android you may use this kind of subscription to notify your application about new items available so it can perform background pre-fetching without user notification.

#### Return Codes

- `201` Subscription created successfuly
- `204` Subscription updated successfuly
- `400` Invalid device id event name format
- `404` The specified device does not exist

### Unsubscribe an Event

To unsubscribe an event, perform a DELETE on the subscription URL.

	> DELETE /device/DEVICE_ID/subscriptions/EVENT_NAME HTTP/1.1
    >
    ---
	< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

#### Return Codes

- `204` Subscription deleted
- `400` Invalid device id event name format
- `404` The specified device does not exist

### List Device's Subscriptions

To get the list of events subscribed by a device, perform a GET on the `/device/DEVICE_ID/subscriptions`.

    > GET /device/DEVICE_ID/subscriptions HTTP/1.1
    >
    ---
    < HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    < {
    <   "EVENT_NAME": {"ignore_message": false},
    <   "EVENT_NAME2": ...
    < }

To test the presence of a single subscription, perform a GET on the subscription URL

    > GET /device/DEVICE_ID/subscriptions/EVENT_NAME HTTP/1.1
    >
    ---
    < HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    < {"ignore_message":false}

Event Ingestion
---------------

To generate notifications, your service must send events to pushd. The service doesn't have to know if a device is subscribed to an event in order to send it, it just send all subscriptable events as they happen and pushd handles the rest.

An event is a JSON object in a specific format sent to pushd either using HTTP POST or UDP datagrams.

### Event Message Format

An event message is a serie of optional key/values:

- `msg`: The event message. If not message is provided, the event will only send data to the app and won't notify the user. *The message can contain placeholders to other keys, see Message Template bellow.*
- `msg.<lang>`: The translated version of the event message. The `<lang>` part must match the `lang` property of a target device. If device use full locale (i.e. `fr_CA`), and no matching locale message is provided, pushd will fallback on a lauguage only version of the message if any (i.e. `fr`). If no translation matches, the `msg` key is used. *The message can contain placeholders to other keys, see Message Template bellow.*
- `data.<key>`: Key/values to be attached to the notification
- `var.<key>`: Stores strings to be reused in `msg` and `<lang>.msg` contents
- `sound`: The name of a sound file to be played. It must match a sound file name contained in you bundle app. (iOS only)

### Event Message Template

The `msg` and `<lang>.msg` keys may contains references to others keys in the event object. You may refer either `data.<key>` or `var.<key>`. Use the `${<key name>}` syntax to refer to those key (ex: `${var.title}`).

Here is an example of event message using translations and templating (spaces and cariage returns have been added for readability):

    msg=${var.name} sent a new video: ${var.title}
    msg.fr=${var.name} a envoyé une nouvelle video: ${var.title}
    sound=newVideo.mp3
    data.user_id=fkwhpd
    data.video_id=1k3dxk
    var.name=Jone Doe
    var.title=Super awesome video

### Event API

#### HTTP

You send an event to pushd over HTTP by POSTing the JSON object to the `/event/EVENT_NAME` endpoint of the pushd server:

    > POST /event/user.newVideo:fkwhpd HTTP/1.1
    > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    >
    > msg=${var.name} sent a new video: ${var.title}&
    > msg.fr=${var.name} a envoyé une nouvelle video: ${var.title}&
    > sound=newVideo.mp3&
    > data.user_id=fkwhpd&
    > data.video_id=1k3dxk&
    > var.name=Jone Doe&
    > var.title=Super awesome video
    ---
    < HTTP/1.1 204 Ok
*Carriage returns are added for readability*

The server will answer OK immediately. This doesn't mean the event has already been delivered.

#### UDP

The UDP event posting API consists of a UDP datagram targetted at the UDP port 80 containing the URI of the event followed by the message content as query-string:

    /event/user.newVideo:fkwhpd?msg=%24%7Bvar.name%7D+sent+a+new+video%3A+%24%7Bvar.title%7D&msg.fr=%24%7Bvar…
